First submission for Kaggle Titanic ML comp

Score: 0.75119

Things that confused me:
Models were very hit or miss. Sometimes giving accuracy scores has high as mid 80's then giving scores in mid 70's. That's why I did 50 iterations and took the average because it was hard to gauge what the true average really was.


Improvements for next time:
More feature engineering
Use categorical variables (hot one encoding)
Test different train/test ratios
Test different hyperparameters on models 
    I did this but I could've done this at a greater scale by making for loops and then finding max of graphs. Just didn't think it was necessary for this dataset
